# Disease Prediction from Medical data :-

A disease prediction model is a model designed to predict the likelihood of a person having a specific disease based on input data. Here I have created a model which comprises of medical data and predicts if a person is having Parkinson's disease or not. Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affect movement leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty with walking, balance, and coordinaton. Here are the steps I have involved in developing the Parkinson's disease prediction model :- 

Step-1: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and evaluation.

Step-2: Load the Parkinson's disease dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Step-3: Display the first five rows, the shape, and basic info of the DataFrame.

Step-4: Check for any missing values in the dataset.

Step-5: Get statistical measures of the dataset.

Step-6: Check the distribution of the target variable 'status'.

Step-7: Calculate the mean of numeric features grouped by the target variable.

Step-8: Separate features (X) and target variable (Y).

Step-9: Split the data into training and testing sets.

Step-10: Fit and transform the training data, and transform the test data using StandardScaler.

Step-11: Initialize and train an SVM model with a linear kernel.

Step-12: Predict and calculate the accuracy of the model on training and testing data.

Step-13: Predict the presence of Parkinson's disease for a single sample input.
